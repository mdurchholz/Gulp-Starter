# **Gulp Starter**

### Run the following commands:

Make sure your current directory is /sources

```cd sources/```

Install all packages listed under dependencies from our package.json

```$ npm install```

**NOTE: The previous --dev flag recursively adds in devDependencies and will cause a very long and possibly endless loop. For now, put all packages inside dependencies.

Globally install the gulp command to use through a command prompt

```$ npm install gulp -g```

Install package from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```$ npm install package-name```

### Gulp Commands:

- gulp            : Runs all commands below
